# Future Work ðŸš§

Details on issues and improvements that should be addressed, and speculate about other uses for the software.

- Graphics API abstraction, could port to Vulkan/Metal/DirectX/OpenGL-ES
- OS Platform abstraction (maybe glutin/winit handles a lot of that)
- Separate window/rendering thread
- Vertex Arrays have a lot of nonsense hard coded stuff
- G-buffer/frame-buffers could do with a refactor
- Shaders should be loaded from disk
- Add actual docs, tests, and benchmarks
- Once this is an acceptable renderer, I might add more game engine features. Maybe try and make a small game
