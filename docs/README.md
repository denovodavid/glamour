- title: Graphics Pipelines
  details: How are graphics APIs utilised to create high-performing real-time rendering pipelines? Design, implement, analyse, and discuss forward rendering and deferred rendering techniques.
- title: Forward Rendering
  details: Each object to be rendered gets rasterised, shaded, and drawn to the screen sequentially. Shading is calculated for each object individually.
- title: Deferred Shading
  details: Rasterise each object's geometry into buffers; position, normal, albedo, etc.. By sampling each of the geometry buffers, shading is calculated for the frame as a whole.
