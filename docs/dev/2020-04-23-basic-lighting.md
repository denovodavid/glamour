# Basic Lighting

One again, many things have happened, as seen in the tweet below. In the past three days I have added the coordinate system with camera and transformations, refactored the rendering API to a more immediate pipeline, and added basic ambient + diffuse + specular shading. All that refactoring of vertex arrays has definitely come in handy and allowed me to fix a couple of bugs as I understood more about what _exactly_ a **vertex array** is.

## Vertex Arrays are not Arrays of Vertices
Well, I knew that much coming into it, but I was lost on the specifics. Here's what I now understand.

::: tip Vertex Array
A **vertex array** is an object that, when currently bound, _captures the state_ of **vertex attributes** and **index buffers**. Binding it again, will _rebind_ that _captured state_.
:::

There are only 4 OpenGL functions that a currently bound **vertex array** will capture state changes of:
#### ðŸ‘‰ [**`glEnableVertexAttribArray(...)` / `glDisableVertexAttribArray(...)`**](http://docs.gl/gl4/glEnableVertexAttribArray)
Enable/disable **vertex attributes**, e.g., enable `location = 0` so I can send vertex positions to my vertex shader.
#### ðŸ‘‰ [**`glVertexAttribPointer(...)`**](http://docs.gl/gl4/glVertexAttribPointer)
Tell OpenGL what part of the **vertex buffer** is the attribute, e.g., the first 3 floats are the position.
::: warning Important! 
Calling this will cause the **vertex array** to _implicity_ capture the currently bound **vertex buffer** to know where the data is.
:::
#### ðŸ‘‰ [**`glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, ...)`**](http://docs.gl/gl4/glBindBuffer)
Bind (or unbind) an **index buffer**.
::: warning Unbinding Matters.
Make sure to unbind the **vertex array** before unbinding the **index buffer**, otherwise (since the same function binds/unbinds), the **vertex array** will capture the _unbound_ state.
:::

Knowing all this now, I have been very careful to bind/unbind everything correctly, in order not to capture the wrong state, or leave my **vertex array** bound. 

> Please, please, this is supposed to be a _happy_ occasion, let's not _bicker_ and _argue_ about who unbound who. We are here today, to witness the **Critical Path** progress.

## Critical Path `v1.1`
1. âœ… **Coordinate System**
    - ~~**Entity** object to encapsulate a **Transform** component and **Renderer** data.~~
      - _Just have a list of transforms as the rendering data is only cubes._
    - ~~**Camera** component to handle view projection transforms, and move around the scene.~~
      - _Camera automatically orbits the scene, no manual control._
    - ~~The [nalgebra-glm](https://crates.io/crates/nalgebra-glm) crate has all the required math funcionality.~~
1. ðŸš§ **Forward Lighting**
    - âœ… ~~**Light** component to with color, strength, and type (directional or spotlight).~~
      - _Just using spotlights for now._
    - **Material** component to encapsulate ambient, diffues, specular, and shininess values.
    - ðŸš§ Create a **GLSL function** to calculate lighting from a **material's** values and all the **light** source values.
1. ðŸš§ **Geometry**
    - âœ… ~~I'm going to skip model loading for now, and just use some pre-defined cube vertex data.~~
    - ðŸš« ~~Maybe I'll render the light sources as little spheres.~~
    - ðŸ’Ž Use [instanced rendering](https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Instancing) to more easily manage **vertex/index/transform data**.
1. âœ‹ **Deferred Shading**
    - I will need to learn how to use **framebuffers**.
    - I might need to do something with the **Depth buffer**.
    - I will need to learn about **Multiple Render Targets** (MRT).
    - Update the lighting calculation to take input from the **G-buffer** framebuffer.
